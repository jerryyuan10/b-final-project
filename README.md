# Skyscrapers App Introduction

This final project called [Skyscrapers Rating App](https://firebase-skyscrapers-app.vercel.app/).

## Motivation for the app

This project will show the existing skyscrapers in the world. These buildings enhance every city's skyline. Users will not only be able to learn about the different buildings around the world through this project, but they can also edit the information by editing, adding, or deleting them.

In this project, users will be able to see the name and the height of the buildings. Also, they can find the completion time and rating of these buildings. It will also show users' comments about some buildings and the structural system of them, but these are optional.

### Current status of the app - what's build and what remains to be built

- Users can add and edit the information of the buildings in this app successfully.
- Users can sort by buildings' height or rating of the building.
- Project has the features of CRUD database operations.
- Although users can edit or add strings, arrays and numbers in the app. I'm still struggling with how to built the Geopoint data in the app.
